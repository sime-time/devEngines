# devEngines CLI

This tool, devEngines CLI, makes it impossible for you to be on the wrong Node or npm version. With it installed, any time you are in a project that has the Node or npm version defined in the `package.json`, it will switch to that version automatically. You never have to run any commands, just set the value in the official "devEngines" part of the `package.json`. This location is defined in the official `package.json` specification. If you want to pin a specific version number, or update to the latest version of a tool, the `devEngines` CLI offers the following commands.


## CLI Commands

1. `devEngines lts`
   * Update all tools listed in the `devEngines` of the local `package.json to a resolved exact version of the most recent LTS release, or latest release if the tool does not have an LTS version.
1. `devEngines latest`
   * Updates the tools listed in the `devEngines` to a resolved exact version of the latest releases
1. Pin tool to a resolved version
   * **Syntax:** `devEngines [toolname]@[version]`
   * **Examples:**
      * `devEngines node@latest`
      * `devEngines node@lts`
      * `devEngines node@24`
      * `devEngines node@24.0.0`
      * `devEngines npm@latest`
      * `devEngines npm@11`
      * `devEngines npm@11.0.0`
1. Use any of the following to set a global fallback to use if `devEngines` are not defined in the local `package.json`, or there is no `package.json` to be found.
   * `devEngines -g latest`
   * `devEngines -g node@latest`
   * `devEngines -g node@lts`
   * `devEngines -g node@24`
   * `devEngines -g node@24.0.0`
   * `devEngines -g npm@latest`
1. Delete all cached tool (Node/npm) versions
   * `devEngines purge`

Anyone on your team that is not using the devEngines CLI tool, will be forced to manually change their Node/npm versions, because the `npm` executable will throw an error if the version used does not match what is defined in the "devEngines" part of the `package.json`.


## Installation:

1. Before installation, remove Node and npm if they are globally installed. Also remove any existing Node version management tools (nvm, n, nodist, nvm-windows, volta, proto, etc).
1. In a command prompt or terminal change to the user profile home directory:
  * **Windows:** `cd %USERPROFILE%`
  * **Linux/OSX:** `cd ~`
1. Clone the repo with one of these commands:
   * **HTTPS:** `git clone https://github.com/TheJaredWilcurt/devEngines.git`
   * **SSH:** `git@github.com:TheJaredWilcurt/devEngines.git`
   * **GitHub CLI:** `gh repo clone TheJaredWilcurt/devEngines`
1. Change directory into the cloned repo:
   * `cd devEngines`
1. Install
   * **Windows:** `install.bat`
   * **Linux/OSX:** `./install.sh`
   * This downloads a local copy of Node.js used exclusively by the devEngines CLI.
   * It also adds folders to the PATH related to the devEngines CLI.


## Usage

1. In your repos, delete any existing Node/npm stored version that are not in the official `"devEngines"` location:
  * `.nvmrc`
  * `.node-version`
  * `mise.toml`
  * `.prototools`
  * `volta` object in the `package.json`
  * etc
1. Run one of the devEngines CLI commands documented above to pin Node/npm to the desired versions.
1. Any time you want to update the Node or npm versions, you can run the `devEngines lts` command.


## Uninstalling

1. In a command prompt or terminal change to the cloned devEngines repo directory:
  * **Windows:** `cd %USERPROFILE%\devEngines`
  * **Linux/OSX:** `cd ~/devEngines`
1. Uninstall
   * **Windows:** `uninstall.bat`
   * **Linux/OSX:** `./uninstall.sh`
   * This removes folders from the PATH related to the devEngines CLI
1. Go up a directory
   * `cd ..`
1. Delete the cloned repo
   * **Windows:** `rd /s /q devEngines`
   * **Linux/OSX:** `rm -r -f ./devEngines`
